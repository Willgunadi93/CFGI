# CFGI

CFGI Mobile App. The purpose of this project is to help Community For Global Innovation (CFGI) to create a mobile application that helps international students stay in the United States through financial assistance and inexpensive legal consultation. This was prototyped, developed, and implemented from January 2021 - June 2021 for the Senior Design class at UCI.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to thank Professor Matthew Bietz, Saumya Gupta, and Andrew Jiang for their guidance during development of our app. We would also like to thank Sophie Alcorn and David Val Verde Vargas for believing in us and shaping our vision of the app. 


## Overview of the App
The following sections will describe the workflow of the app from both the front-end and back-end users perspective, what each of the components do, and future features that we would like implemented in the future. 

## Financial Aid
The Financial Aid is made of 4 main components/screens:
* financial.js - The landing page of the financial aid application, which briefly describes what financial aid is for and links the user to both the actual application and the terms and conditions. <br/> While this page will probably remain the same, one future feature idea that could be implemented is not allowing the user to apply for financial aid while their application is being reviewed to prevent spam and exploitation.  
* termsAndConditions.js - The terms and conditions that the user agrees to when they apply for financial aid. Nothing special about this one, it's just a long text document. Wording may change depending on legal stuff with CFGI, but the component itself will remain the same.  
* FinDocScreen.js - The actual application itself, this will have its own description down below. 
* FinAppConfirmationScreen.js - A confirmation page that will tell the user that their information has been submitted to CFGI. This will remain the same in future development.
